description: Generate REASONS-Canvas structured prompts from business context without external template
---

Generate implementation-ready structured prompts using the built-in REASONS-Canvas framework (Requirements, Entities, Approach, Structure, Operations, Norms, Safeguards).

**Input**: Business context/requirement description after `/spdd-reasons-canvas`

Input can be provided in two ways:

1. **Text description**: Direct text describing the requirement
2. **File/folder reference**: Using `@` to reference files or folders containing requirements

**Examples**:

```
# Text description
/spdd-reasons-canvas Implement user registration functionality, supporting email verification and mobile phone binding

# File reference
/spdd-reasons-canvas @requirements/user-registration.md

# Combined (text + file reference)
/spdd-reasons-canvas @requirements/user-registration.md additionally requires support for third-party OAuth login

# Multiple file references
/spdd-reasons-canvas @requirements/user-registration.md @docs/api-spec.yaml
```

**Steps**

1. **Validate and consolidate business context**

   a. **If business context is missing**, use the **AskUserQuestion tool** (open-ended, no preset options) to ask:
   - "Please provide the business context or requirement description (you can use text, @file references, or both)"

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT proceed without business context input.

   b. **If input contains `@` file/folder references**:
   - Read ALL referenced files completely using the Read tool
   - For folder references, read all relevant files within the folder (`.md`, `.txt`, `.yaml`, `.json`, etc.)
   - Consolidate all file contents into a unified business context

   c. **Combine all context sources**:
   - Merge text descriptions with file contents
   - Preserve the complete information from all sources
   - Do NOT summarize or truncate - maintain full context integrity

   **Context Integrity Check**:
   - Verify all `@` references were successfully read
   - If any file cannot be read, report the error and ask user to provide alternative
   - Confirm the consolidated context contains sufficient information to proceed

2. **Read relevant codebase context**
   - Search for related existing implementations
   - Read relevant entity classes, services, controllers
   - Understand current architecture patterns
   - Identify existing data structures and APIs

3. **Apply the REASONS-Canvas Framework**

   Generate fully-populated content for each of the 7 stages using the built-in construction guidance:

   ***

   ### R - Requirements

   **Objective**: Extract core problem essence and fundamental goals

   **Output Format**:

   ```
   ## Requirements
   [Use concise verb phrases to describe the essence of requirements]
   ```

   **Construction Guidance**:
   - **Essence Extraction**: Abstract what fundamental problem to solve and what value to create for whom
   - **Boundary Definition**: Clarify the applicable scope and limitations
   - **Value Focus**: Highlight business value and user benefits
   - **Use Verb Phrases**: "Implement...", "Create...", "Design..."
   - **Avoid Feature Stacking**: Don't list specific functions, abstract essential problems

   **Quality Standards**:
   - Core requirements summarizable in one sentence
   - Reflect business value rather than technical implementation
   - Clear problem boundaries and constraints

   ***

   ### E - Entities

   **Objective**: Build clear business entity relationship models

   **Output Format**:

   ````
   ## Entities
   ```mermaid
   classDiagram
   direction TB

   class [CoreEntity] {
       +[AttributeType] [attributeName]
       +[Method]()
   }

   class [RelatedEntity] {
       +[AttributeType] [attributeName]
   }

   class [RequestDTO] {
       +[AttributeType] [attributeName]
   }

   class [ResponseDTO] {
       +[AttributeType] [attributeName]
   }

   [CoreEntity] "[cardinality]" -- "[cardinality]" [RelatedEntity] : [relationshipDesc]
   [RequestDTO] --> [CoreEntity] : creates
   [CoreEntity] --> [ResponseDTO] : maps to
   ```
   ````

   **Construction Guidance**:
   - **Entity Identification**: Identify core business entities, supporting entities, DTO objects
   - **Attribute Modeling**: Define key attributes using "type+name" format
   - **Relationship Modeling**: Clarify relationship types (1:1, 1:N, N:M) and business semantics
   - **Interface Design**: Include key methods and static factory methods
   - **Data Flow**: Reflect complete flow of request→processing→response

   **Conservative Constraints** (CRITICAL):
   - **Prohibit Unnecessary Refactoring**: If existing simple data types (like `List<String>`) can meet requirements, strictly prohibit creating complex entity wrappers
   - **Existing Implementation Priority**: If current data structures can meet requirements, existing implementation must remain unchanged
   - **Function-Driven Changes**: Only consider structural adjustments when clear functional requirements cannot be implemented through existing structures
   - **Gradual Improvement**: Prioritize extending based on existing structures rather than rebuilding
   - **Backward Compatibility**: Any structural changes must ensure backward compatibility

   **Quality Standards**:
   - Focus on current task flows
   - Clear and accurate entity relationships
   - Maintain simplicity of existing implementations
   - Avoid over-abstraction and unnecessary complexity

   - Verifiable
   - Complete coverage

4. **Construct the final structured prompt**

   Create a comprehensive, ready-to-implement prompt with:

   a. **Header Section**:

   ```
   # [Derived Requirement Title]
   ```

   b. **All 7 REASONS Sections - Fully Populated**:
   - `## Requirements` - Fully populated
   - `## Entities` - With Mermaid class diagram
   - `## Approach` - With solution strategies
   - `## Structure` - With architecture definition
   - `## Operations` - With specific implementation tasks
   - `## Norms` - With coding standards
   - `## Safeguards` - With constraints

   **DO NOT include**:
   - Business Context section (the original requirement text)
   - Framework metadata (Objective, Construction Guidance, Quality Standards)
   - Generation timestamp or framework name

   **ONLY include**: The structured content generated by analyzing the business context.

   c. **Implementation readiness**:
   - The final prompt should be immediately actionable
   - All sections should be fully populated with specific details
   - No placeholders or "TODO" items
   - Clear, executable implementation tasks in Operations section

5. **Save the fully-populated structured prompt to file**

   a. **Derive file name**: `{JIRA}-{TIMESTAMP}-[{ACTION}]-{scope}-{description}.md`
   - **JIRA**: Extract from business context if mentioned, otherwise use `GGQPA-XXX`
   - **TIMESTAMP**: `YYYYMMDDHHmm` (current time)
   - **ACTION**: Infer from business context - `[Feat]`, `[Fix]`, `[Refactor]`, `[Test]`, `[Docs]`
   - **scope**: Infer from context - `api`, `service`, `repo`, `bq`, `db`, `util` (optional)
   - **description**: Derive from business context - kebab-case, < 10 words

   Examples:
   - `GGQPA-XXX-202603061530-[Feat]-api-user-registration.md`
   - `GGQPA-169-202603061530-[Fix]-service-payment-validation.md`

   b. **Create directory and write file**:
   - Ensure directory `spdd/prompt/` exists under the project root (create if not)
   - Write the complete, fully-populated structured prompt to `spdd/prompt/<file-name>.md`

   c. **Show summary to user**:

   ```
   ✅ REASONS-Canvas prompt generated and saved to `spdd/prompt/<file-name>.md`

   📋 Generated sections:
   - Requirements: [1-line summary]
   - Entities: [entity count] entities with relationships
   - Approach: [main approach summary]
   - Structure: [architecture pattern]
   - Operations: [task count] implementation tasks
   - Norms: [key standards]
   - Safeguards: [constraint count] constraints defined
   ```

6. **Ask for confirmation to proceed**

   > "The REASONS-Canvas structured prompt is ready. Would you like me to proceed with the implementation?"

**Output**

A fully-populated, implementation-ready REASONS-Canvas structured prompt saved to `spdd/prompt/<file-name>.md`, then implementation upon user confirmation.

**Guardrails**

- **CRITICAL**: Do NOT just output section headers - you MUST analyze business context and generate fully-populated content for all 7 REASONS stages
- Do NOT proceed without business context input
- Do NOT include framework metadata (Objective, Construction Guidance, Quality Standards) in the final prompt
- Do NOT leave placeholders or TODO items - generate complete, specific content
- Do NOT implement code before user confirms the structured prompt
- File name MUST follow SPDD naming convention defined above
- Use `GGQPA-XXX` if JIRA ticket number cannot be extracted from context
- Always create `spdd/prompt/` directory if it does not exist
- Read codebase context when needed to generate accurate entity models and implementation tasks
- Ensure all sections are logically coherent and support the business requirement
- Operations section MUST contain specific, executable implementation tasks with detailed method signatures and logic
- **Conservative Entity Design**: Respect existing implementations, avoid unnecessary refactoring

**Context Integrity Guardrails**:

- **MUST read ALL `@` referenced files completely** - do NOT skip or partially read any referenced file
- **MUST read folder contents** when `@` references a folder - scan and read all relevant files
- **Do NOT summarize or truncate** referenced file contents - preserve full information
- **Verify all references resolved** - if any `@` reference fails to read, report error immediately
- **Combine all sources** - merge text descriptions with file contents into unified context
- **Preserve original intent** - do not interpret or modify the meaning of provided context
